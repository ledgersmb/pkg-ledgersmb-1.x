debian/TODO for LedgerSMB ledgersmb-1.5 package


-> Having problems with both the init and the service file;  OTOH, it doesn't
even run manually, and without logging I can't see why for sure. Just get a
"500 Internal Server Error".  If nothing else, review the required modules.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- When 1.5.9 comes out & I have it available, check it again without the 
lintian overrides (including the source overrides?) so can compare which types
are coming up.  Also because there is a legit reason for the UI/js/lsmb override,
since the actual sources for those are in UI/js-src/lsmb and the write up for 
the overide should reflect that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update debian/Readme.Debian as necessary.
Update debian/Readme.sources as necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Update d/copyright regarding UI/js as necessary.

- In bin/*, there have been a number of the files that have been updated by us but 
  at varied times over the last serveral years. Just use 2017 as the end year for 
  all, rather than try to list them all?  Or is included already in the main stanza?
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Line 29 in the -apache  post install script still needs to be corrected.?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To fix an issue with 1.5.9, added the following line to d/ledgersmb-1.5.install:
+UI/js/dijit/themes/claro/images/loadingAnimation.gif UI/js/dijit/icons/images

	- The fix for the issue is already in upstream and should be in 1.5.10:
Fix image location for 'loading' animation -  22 July 2017
 https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/commit/552498906ea3acd16e8dbfd46b84ef602981a2df
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- debian/ledgersmb.init
	There is a '--workers $WORKERS' parameter being used in the STARMAN cmd
line but that variable does not actually get set earlier in the script.  Be
interesting to see what David comes up with, as he was critiquing the init
in the ledgersmb (I think?), which has the same issue, but didn't comment on
it.  Refer back to the original script I adapted mine from?  Or wait for the
one to be made by David?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Interesting enough; this is available for Config::Model
https://metacpan.org/release/Config-Model-Systemd
	-> It's been in Debian since Stretch
	https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/libconfig-model-systemd-perl

	- So if there will be a need to do a debconf update for the service file, will
	be able to do so.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Update the patch for the config file to change the value for the
'cookie_name'. Upstream already has it as "LedgerSMB-1.5", presumably after the
major.minor version, while I have changed other such variables to being after the
package name.  Since they've already done that; do something like add an "LSMB" or
"lsmb" to the end?
	- Also; add to the existing comment for that value, something to the effect of
what was similarly added for the main ledgersmb package:
"This is initially set to differeniate from upstream by adding "-ds" to the end."
but in this case, use "lsmb" or which ever I decide.
	- Also add something to the README.Debian about it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An unneeded /etc/ledgersmb/conf directory appears to be getting created, perhaps
during the pkg install? Although it's dated 26 May 2017 and is not in the deb pkg
and the current pkg was installed yesterday on 16 .
Next time I purge the pkg, verify at least that all of the pkg directories are 
removed.

`- Project has totally moved from SourceForge.net, so debian/watch needs to be
`updated for the new locations of the distribution archive and its detached
`gpg file for verification.

- An update for getting the distribution archive itself appears to have been
successful but the *.asc associated with it used for the gpg verification does
not seem to get refereneced properly so that step fails. (So creating the orig
archive needs to be done manually.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- There is an issue with the debconf usage (besides the issue with the templates) during the 
	pkg install.

- Note that there is an extranous "DO" showing up.  Possibly that's 
from debconf script that is not running properly, which it should because it's
defaulted to do so.  Maybe there's a problem with where it's supposed to be 
running in the maintainer script, as running dpkg-reconfigure on it runs
it with no apparant issue.  (Athought it also ended up displaying the extraneous
"DO" at the bottom left hand corner of the last debconf diaplay.)
 So perhaps there is an issue with the *.config file after all? Or is it indeed some to do with
 it the usage in the maintainer script.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Looks like an Lighttpd configuration example is going to be added.  If/when
	it's also added to the 1.5, add another binary stanza for it to go along with
	the ones for nginx and apache.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A varnish example config, default.vcl, is already available.  Create another binary stanza in the
d/control file in order to add it.  ledgersmb-1.5-varnish.  The config goes to /etc/varnish? 
The existing config does have port setting incorrect, so add it after port is set properly to 5762.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Discussed in IRC some of the permission fix issues.  Erik took care of
  fixing many of them in both master & 1.5 so when the next release comes out
  will need to run a build of both ledgresmb & ledgersmb-1.5 without the 
  fixes enabled in order to check how the fix permissions stanza in d/rules
  can be updated for that.
  - Referance also https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2899 which 
  for the creation of a test in upstream that checks for such permission issues.

- As of the packageing for 1.5.8, this is what is in the override_dh_fixperms

Although Debian (and others) do now use systemd by default, it does still support sysvinit
init.d scripts as well, so providing at least an example init.d sysvinit startup script
 for starman-ledgersmb would be quite useful.

- In the mean time, added an initial version of a possible script:
In order to test how that works, would have to use something that has been
changed to use sysv instead of systemd;  have been able to do some testing of it but it's
still not working properly so it needs more work.

  - debian/adm/config-lsmb-db-user.sh
- Use 'pg_roles' and 'rolname' rather than 'pg_users' and 'usename', as I 
found that one can actually create two roles with the same name, one with the
login attribute and one without.

	- Use 'git cherrypick' to pull in the changes already released in 
	v1.4.41-1+ds.
	
- Use only the postgresql tools, like createuser, to set the user name and 
password for the LSMB DB Admin user.  David G pointed out that using SQL
can allow the unencrypted password to perhaps show up in logs, etc, which
is a security concern.
- Take out defaulting for doing the SQL 'ALTER' instead of a 'CREATE'
if the LSMB DBAdmin user already exits.  It was pointed out by both David
and Erik that they really don't think it's a good idea to reset that password
by default when, for instance, upgradeing the package;  which is what it did
if doing the configure was enabled.  Add option to reset the password if the
user ID already exists, but not by default; would have to explicitly agree
to it, each time, and that agreement isn't saved so the question gets asked
each time and by default is not to do the reset.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Use a separate source tarball for the UI/js/dojo and UI/js/dijit directories?
Devs have discussed it some but nothing has come of it as yet. If it's provided,
then a way to bypass all source-is-missing lintian errors on those directories
could be to use the multiple upstream tarballs functionality that's available
in the debian pkgformat being used. 

https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0
https://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/09/07/how-to-use-multiple-upstream-tarballs-in-debian-source-packages/  

google search: debian package multiple source files


Note that this isn't necessary for the UI/js/lsmb directory because the source
for those are in the UI/js-src/lsmb directory. Although could perhaps investigate
where and how the lintian check looks for the source files to see if repacking
them where it looks for them would resolve this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Currently have texlive-latex-recommended as a Recommends but that pulls a lot of
of other pkgs in and takes alot of space, and is only there regarding being able
to print to PDF.  Options for how replace that at least for default printing
(some people will continue to use LaTex because they have dedicated resources
to it) have/are being generated, like modules or apps to print from html to pdf.
  Once that has been implemented, move the texlive requirement from Recommends to
Suggests and add some info about it to the README.Debian.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?
