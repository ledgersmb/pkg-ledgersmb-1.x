debian/TODO for ledgersmb-1.4 package


===============================================================================
===============================================================================


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- debian/adm/conmfig-lsmb-db-user.sh
- Use 'pg_roles' and 'rolname' rather than 'pg_users' and 'usename', as I 
found that one can actually create two roles with the same name, one with the
login attribute and one without.
- Use only the postgresql tools, like createuser, to set the user name and 
password for the LSMB DB Admin user.  David G pointed out that using SQL
can allow the unencrypted password to prehaps show up in logs, etc, which
is a sucurity concern.
- Already took out defaulting for doing the SQL 'ALTER' instead of a 'CREATE'
if the LSMB DBAdmin user already exits.  It was pointed out by both David
and Erik that they really don't think it's a good idea to reset that password
by default when, for instance, upgradeing the package;  which is what it did
if doing the configure was enabled.  Add option to reset the password if the
user ID already exists, but not by default; would have to explicitly agree
to it, each time, and that agreement isn't saved so the question gets asked
each time and by default is not to do the reset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Suggested by 'Kiwi' in LedgerSMB chat site  (riot)
While we're at it, the title for ledgersmb at packages.debian.org is "(web):
 financial accounting and ERP program". Perhaps "Full featured financial 
 accounting package accessed via web browser (PERL/SQL backend)" would give
  more info?
Options
or  "Full featured, open source financial..."

  -> agree it needs updating and I've been wanting to, but that's too long
  for the short description.
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- debian/watch: expand the uversionmangle regular expression to exclude the v1.2,
1.3, and 1.5 versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of doc/templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s), 
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting? (Would
the apache config also need to be updated to allow that?)
