Description: financial accounting and ERP program (Perl/SQL backend)
 LedgerSMB is a full featured double-entry financial accounting and Enterprise
 Resource Planning system accessed via a web browser (Perl/SQL backend) which
 offers "Accounts Receivable", "Accounts Payable" and "General Ledger" tracking
 as well as inventory control and fixed assets handling. The LedgerSMB client
 can be a web browser or a programmed API call. The goal of the LedgerSMB
 project is to bring high quality ERP and accounting capabilities to Small
 and Midsize Businesses.
 .
 The application now defaults to being made available on port 5762 and being
 run directly by Starman instead of by Apache. If other access is needed, a
 Reverse Proxy can be configured locally using Apache, Lighttpd, Nginx, or
 Varnish and using the appropriate dependency packages to select which. For more
 information, please see also /usr/share/doc/ledgersmb-1.6/README.Debian.
