=head1 NAME

LedgerSMB::Auth - Provides an abstraction layer for authentication.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine provides an abstraction layer for authentication.  The current
application only ships with a simple authentication layer using
database-native accounts.  Other authentication methods are quite
possible though currently every LedgerSMB user must be a database user.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 factory($env)

This method instantiates an authentication class as of type
LedgerSMB::Auth::C<$LedgerSMB::Sysconfig::auth>.
More about plugin classes is described below.

=head2 plugin classes

Each plugin module must provide a class with the following methods

=over

=item new(env => $env)

$env is a hash describing the web request environment such as defined
by RFC 3875 (CGI version 1.1) and adopted by the PSGI standard.

=item get_credentials($domain)

Get credentials and return them to the application, optionally taking
$domain into account ($domain can be any of 'setup' or 'main').

Must return a hashref with the following entries:

login
password

Returning a hashref without these entries means that no valid
login data is available.
