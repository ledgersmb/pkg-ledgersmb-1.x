# The files in this dir are sample config files.
You should not modify any files directly in this dir.
Rather you should copy the ones you need into their correct locations and edit the copies to match your installation


## directories
- systemd
This directory provides sample systemd service files to run ledgersmb on boot

## httpd daemon config files
We don't directly serve LedgerSMB via the HTTP Daemon, rather we use the daemon to reverse proxy to a plackup or starman instance
This is done for significant performance gains
ONLY one of these should be copied into the appropriate system config dir and modified as explained within the file.
on debian systems it would be a subdir of /etc/nginx/ or /etc/apache/
- apache-vhost.conf
Sample apache config file
- nginx-vhost.conf
Sample nginx config file
- default.vcl
Sample Varnish config file

## LedgerSMB config files
One of these should be coppied into the ledgersmb install dir unless the location is overridden with an environment variable.
- ledgersmb.conf.default
a "normal" config, it uses the bundled built dojo and is the preffered config to use
- ledgersmb.conf.unbuilt-dojo
If installing using a tarball or system package, this file should only be used if local changes to any of our dojo, Javascript, or HTML resources are made
However if running from a git or other source install, then you will either need to run with unbuilt-dojo (src) or pull in our submodules and build our dojo target.
__WARNING:__ Running with unbuilt dojo will have a noticable performance reduction in most cases.

## Other Files
- README.md
This readme file of course ;-)

## testing infrastructure files
These files are not for normal use, they are intended for use on the travis-ci testing servers
- ledgersmb.conf.travis-ci
ledgersmb.conf file configured for running tests on travis
- nginx-travis.conf
httpd config file configured for running tests on travis
