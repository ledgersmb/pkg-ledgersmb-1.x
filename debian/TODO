debian/TODO for LedgerSMB ledgersmb-1.6 package

  - See also https://github.com/ledgersmb/pkg-ledgersmb-1.6/issues
  
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Is the 'xedemo' coming up as the default template when creating a new company
  DB? I'd thought it was not but a user (sbay) thought it was and in any case
  ended up that way and had troubles because the texlive-xetex pkg was not
  installed yet.
- Investigate again which template is the default and in any case, look into
  what can be done within the app to verify/ensure that needed pkg is installed
  if needed.

- Also, as per Erik (at 15:24 in IRC on 10 Mar 2018); 

be sure to install the liberation font though
the templates use those.
I'm not sure if they came with xelatex
(xetex)

sbay
Which ones
15:27
fonts-liberation - Fonts with the same metrics as Times, Arial and Courier
fonts-liberation2 Fonts with the same metrics as Times, Arial and Courier (v2)
E
ehuelsmann
the second ones are ok.

sysop@svrdb:~$ aptitude search fonts-liberation
i   fonts-liberation                                         - Fonts with the same metrics as Times, Arial and Courier
p   fonts-liberation2                                        - Fonts with the same metrics as Times, Arial and Courier (v2)

- Note that Erik also noted that the v2 of that was basically what he choose to
install in a recent new install.  he's not sure that it actually makes a big
differnce.  And I'm not sure how it got installed on my install;  it was not
automatially installed (according to 'apt show').  So, if it's needed like that
need to insure that it gets installed, even if indirectly, so investigate how
it gets done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch the SSL settings in the app proxy to use the 'snakeoil' certs by default
- Confirm which package installs that & add it to at least the Recommends?  I've
thought that it is ssl-cert.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Implemented a work-around that halved (from 60 to 30) the number of the
source-is-missing Lintian errors in the ledgersmb pkg. Implememt the same in
this pkg but not until the next version, which I expect to be 1.5.18, so that
only have to copy the UI/js/lsmb file to debian/missing-sources once (and not
again when the new version came out).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Add a doc-base file for UI/welcome.html ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- debian/ledgersmb.init
  There is a '--workers $WORKERS' parameter being used in the STARMAN cmd
line but that variable does not actually get set earlier in the script.  Be
interesting to see what David comes up with, as he was critiquing the init
in the ledgersmb (I think?), which has the same issue, but didn't comment on
it.  Refer back to the original script I adapted mine from?  Or wait for the
one to be made by David?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The dbadmin related questions only need to be asked if this is a new install
  and if it is a reconfigure.  Although in that case, perhaps there should be
  question about if the password should be changed which defaults to "No"?
  (Although then, would it need to be defaulted to 'Yes' and set to "No after
  it's been set or reset?)  But for by default the dbadmin user & its password
  should only be set in a new install, so that upgrades will not do it again.
  Perhaps only the reconfigure would have question about resetting the password,
  with a default of no?   
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - debian/adm/config-lsmb-db-user.sh

- Use only the postgresql tools, like createuser, to set the user name and 
password for the LSMB DB Admin user?  David G pointed out that using SQL
can allow the unencrypted password to perhaps show up in logs, etc, which
is a security concern.  So, use the sql to be able to tell if the user
is already present but use the standard tools to actually set it?  Or can
those be used unattended like is needed here?

- Take out defaulting to doing the SQL 'ALTER' instead of a 'CREATE'
if the LSMB DBAdmin user already exits? 
 Add option to reset the password if the
user ID already exists, but not by default? Would have to explicitly agree
to it, each time, and that agreement isn't saved so the question gets asked
each time and by default is not to do the reset?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Discussed in IRC some of the permission fix issues.  Erik took care of
  fixing many of them in both master & 1.5 so when the next release comes out
  will need to run a build of both ledgresmb & ledgersmb-1.5 without the 
  fixes enabled in order to check how the fix permissions stanza in d/rules
  can be updated for that.
  - Referance also https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2899 which is
  for the creation of a test in upstream that checks for such permission issues.

- As of the packageing for 1.6.5, this is what is in the override_dh_fixperms
  stanza:
<-->dh_fixperms
	chmod +x debian/ledgersmb-1.6/usr/share/ledgersmb-1.6/bin/drop-roles
	chmod +x debian/ledgersmb-1.6/usr/share/ledgersmb-1.6/sql/modules/reload_modules.sh
	chmod +x debian/ledgersmb-1.6/usr/share/ledgersmb-1.6/utils/notify_short/config.pl
	chmod +x debian/ledgersmb-1.6/usr/share/ledgersmb-1.6/utils/notify_short/listener.pl
	chmod +x debian/ledgersmb-1.6/usr/share/ledgersmb-1.6/utils/process_queue/config.pl.default
	chmod +x debian/ledgersmb-1.6/usr/share/ledgersmb-1.6/utils/process_queue/process_queue.pl

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although Debian (and others) do now use systemd by default, it does still
support sysvinit init.d scripts as well, so providing at least an example
init.d sysvinit startup script for starman-ledgersmb would be quite useful

- In the mean time, added an initial version of a possible script:
In order to test how that works, would have to use something that has been
changed to use sysv instead of systemd;  have been able to do some testing of
it but it's still not working properly so it needs more work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Currently have texlive-latex-recommended as a Recommends but that pulls a lot of
of other pkgs in and takes alot of space, and is only there regarding being able
to print to PDF.  Options for how to replace that at least for default printing
(some people will continue to use LaTex because they have dedicated resources
to it) have/are being generated, like modules or apps to print from html to pdf.
  Once that has been implemented, move the texlive requirement from Recommends to
Suggests and add some info about it to the README.Debian.

- Note that what has been discussed for an alternate default for printing has
been 'wkhtml2pdf'. See also:

  - Interesting enough; this is available for Config::Model
https://metacpan.org/release/Config-Model-Systemd
  -> It's been in Debian since Stretch
  https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/libconfig-model-systemd-perl

  - So if there is a need to do a debconf update for the service file, will
  be able to do so?
- Being able to update the service file for the LSMB Starman port from the 
postinstall script may be quite useful. One could default to the standard port
but still be able to set it to run on a different port, which would allow multiple
lsmb installs of 1.5 or later. Investigate?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Use a separate source tarball for the UI/js/dojo and UI/js/dijit directories?
Devs have discussed it some but nothing has come of it as yet. If it's provided,
then a way to bypass all source-is-missing lintian errors on those directories
could be to use the multiple upstream tarballs functionality that's available
in the debian pkg format being used. 

https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0
https://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/09/07/how-to-use-multiple-upstream-tarballs-in-debian-source-packages/  

google search: debian package multiple source files

Note that this isn't necessary for the UI/js/lsmb directory because the source
for those are in the UI/js-src/lsmb directory. Although could perhaps investigate
where and how the lintian check looks for the source files to see if repacking
them where it looks for them would resolve this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version? And to recreate the pdf version, to insure that it
is the from the current source file?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language.
