# BDD Tests

The category '66-cucumber' is a bit of a misnomer: these tests are
really browser based tests and we use the principles from BDD to
specify the test scripts and drive the browser engine.


# Test groups

Tests have been grouped by function:

```plain
  00-09 Basic operation and system configuration tests
  10-19 Accounting tests
  20-29 Quotation and orders
  30-39 Inventory and shipping
```

# Running the tests

The tests are integrated with the 'make test' test framework. However,
they can be run separately as well, using the 'pherkin' test runner
which comes with Test:BDD::Cucumber:

```sh
 $ PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=password \
     LSMB_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000" \
     PSGI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000" \
     pherkin t/66-cucumber/*/
```

or when running just a single feature file:

```sh
 $ PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=password LSMB_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000" \
     pherkin t/66-cucumber/01-basic/closing.feature
```

In separate terminals, you need to run the following commands from the
root of the development tree for the above to work:

```sh
 $ starman bin/ledgersmb-server.psgi
 $ phantomjs --webdriver=4422
```

# Code structure

The code consists of the following components:

 * Feature files (*.feature), grouped by function into the directories
   numbered as defined above (e.g. `t/66-cucumber/01-basic/`)
 * Step files, which implement function specific steps, in a
   `step_definitions` subdirectory of each numbered directory
   (e.g. `01-basic/step_definitions/`)
 * `pherkin` extensions in `xt/lib/Pherkin/Extension` which implement
   * `LedgerSMB`: Steps which define application state (provides
     database handle access)
   * `PageObject`: Steps to access the browser UI, common to most
     test scripts
 * `PageObject`s (in `xt/lib/`)
   * implementing access to browser page
     functionality, deriving from `Weasel::Element`, thereby referring
     to their root DOM element
   * self-registering Weasel::WidgetHandler-s and Weasel::FindExpander-s,
     keeping DOM-tree knowledge local to the PageObject

## Structure of feature files

The general structure of feature files is well documented elsewhere on
the web ((See https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)[https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/]).
The general structure consists of N sections:

 * Feature (only one section allowed)
 * Background (optional; only a single background allowed)
 * Scenario (at least one, but potentially many)

The `Feature` section describes the feature being tested. There's no need
to be terse: this is for documentation purposes and sets the boundaries
of what will be tested in the scenarios.

The `Background` section (when available) specifies steps to be prepended
to every scenario in the feature file.

The `Scenario` sections test the various behaviours of the feature. There
are several best practices for writing scenarios:

 * Each scenario tests one behaviour
 * Each scenario is independent from others
   which means that scenarios can be run without requiring
   the others to run as well, in any specific sequence

To achieve independence, each scenario runs in its own copy of the
test database.

### Tagging features and scenarios

Tags can be used to classify scenarios. By tagging a feature, all
scenarios within that feature will be applied the given tag. Tags
are at-sign prefixed words on the line before the `Feature:` or
`Scenario:` keyword. E.g.:

```plain
@weasel
Feature: Bulk payments

@wip
Scenario: Add payments to a new batch
```

The following tags are available:

 * `@weasel`  
   This tag signals to the Weasel plugin to expect browser-based
   tests (and thus to initialize the browser environment)
 * `@wip`  
   This tag signals to the test framework that the test isn't done
   and should be skipped during Continuous Integration test runs
 * `@one-db`  
   This tag signals to the LedgerSMB plugin that all the scenarios
   in this feature should run against the same database. This is a
   performance optimization which should *only* be applied when the
   tests don't modify the database they're running againsts. That way
   independence of scenarios within the feature is maintained.


# DOM tree mapping

The DOM tree's root element (`html`), maps to PageObject::Root, by
overriding Weasel::Session's `page_class` attribute.

The pages from setup.pl and the two pages from login.pl (the login page
and the single-page app) are identified through the 'id' attribute of the
`body` tag.

The single page app's DOM tree:

  * Weasel::Session's `page` attribute (PageObject::Root)
    * `body` attribute (PageObject::App)
      * `menu` attribute (PageObject::App::Menu)
      * `maindiv` attribute (PageObject::App::Main)
        * `content` attribute (PageObject::App::*)

The BDD scripts refer to the `body` attribute's value above as
"the page", while they refer to the `content` attribute's value as
"the screen".

# DOM tree changes

In-browser actions change the DOM tree, e.g. due to form submission
replacing the entire page or the `#maindiv` content referred to
by `body` and `content` respectively.

The `content` accessor compensates for DOM tree changes and stale
attribute values by testing 'staleness' before returning the value,
thereby reducing the window of opportunity for race conditions.

As far as timing is concerned: steps prior to the current one aren't
guaranteed to leave the expected value in the `content` attribute,
e.g. because the div hasn't fully loaded yet. Another reason could be
that steps were used which don't ensure (re)loading of the `content`
attribute.

## Expecting specific widgets as return values

When a specific widget is expected to be returned, the receiver should
use the session's wait_for() function to poll for the correct return
type. The default settings for wait_for make it poll for a number of
seconds.  A good example is the `Then 'I should see the <screen-name>
screen'` step in `xt/lib/Pherkin/Extensions/pageobject_steps/nav_steps.pl`.

Caching accessors, such as `content` above, should be resistent to the
'repeated accessing' pattern caused by this polling behaviour by validating
the validity (not being stale) of the return value and refreshing the
cache when staleness is detected.
