debian/TODO for LedgerSMB ledgersmb-1.5 package

  - See also https://github.com/ledgersmb/pkg-ledgersmb-1.5/issues
  
====================================================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update debian/Readme.Debian as necessary.
Update debian/Readme.sources as necessary.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The addition of an ledgersmb-apache binary deb was attempted but it does
not seem to install cleanly, so that will need further investigation. See
the dev/ApacheProxy development branch at the packaging repository as well
as the following issue:
https://github.com/ledgersmb/pkg-ledgersmb-1.5/issues/2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Looks like an Lighttpd configuration example has been added. Add another
  binary stanza for it to go along with the ones for nginx and apache.

Update conf/README.md regarding 'lighttpd.conf.template'.
https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/3007

 #3126: Rename Lighttpd sample config file [open] - https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/pull/3126

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A varnish example config, default.vcl, is already available.  Create another 
binary stanza in the d/control file in order to add it:  ledgersmb-varnish.  
The config goes to /etc/varnish? The existing config does not have the port set 
correctly, so add it after the port is set properly to 5762.
- But shouldn't the name for that be varnish-proxy.vcl if not varnish-proxy.conf?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- debian/ledgersmb.init
  There is a '--workers $WORKERS' parameter being used in the STARMAN cmd
line but that variable does not actually get set earlier in the script.  Be
interesting to see what David comes up with, as he was critiquing the init
in the ledgersmb (I think?), which has the same issue, but didn't comment on
it.  Refer back to the original script I adapted mine from?  Or wait for the
one to be made by David?
- See also: Provide a sysvinit init.d script for starman-ledgesmb
  https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2900

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Interesting enough; this is available for Config::Model
https://metacpan.org/release/Config-Model-Systemd
  -> It's been in Debian since Stretch
  https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/libconfig-model-systemd-perl

  - So if there is a need to do a debconf update for the service file, will
  be able to do so.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An unneeded /etc/ledgersmb/conf directory appears to be getting created, perhaps
during the pkg install? It's not in the deb pkg.
Next time I purge the pkg, verify at least that all of the pkg directories are 
removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868724
`- Project has totally moved from SourceForge.net, so debian/watch needs to be
`updated for the new locations of the distribution archive and its detached
`gpg file for verification.

- An update for getting the distribution archive itself appears to have been
successful but the *.asc associated with it used for the gpg verification does
not seem to get refereneced properly so that step fails. (So creating the orig
archive needs to be done manually.) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - There may be an issue with the debconf usage (besides the issue with the
  templates) during the pkg install.

- Note that there is an extranous "DO" showing up.  Possibly that's 
from debconf script that is not running properly, which it should because it's
defaulted to do so.  Maybe there's a problem with where it's supposed to be 
running in the maintainer script, as running dpkg-reconfigure on it runs
it with no apparant issue.  (Athought it also ended up displaying the extraneous
"DO" at the bottom left hand corner of the last debconf diaplay.)
 So perhaps there is an issue with the *.config file after all? Or is it indeed
 some to do with it the usage in the maintainer script.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Review the copyright settings for the debian/ directory again back to the
 beginning of the LedgerSMB packaging as although it may have listed 'GPL'
 as the license involved I'm not so sure that GPL3 existed back then and
 that is what it points to now. May have been just GPL2+, like ledgersmb
 itself; if so, add a comment to the stanza noting that.
- According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License,
"In 2007, the third version of the license (GNU GPLv3) was released"
- But LedgerSMB was originally debianized on Mon, 13 Nov 2006 15:29:53,
 viewable in the packaging repostory with the inport of version 1.2.5-2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Discussed in IRC some of the permission fix issues.  Erik took care of
  fixing many of them in both master & 1.5 so when the next release comes out
  will need to run a build of both ledgresmb & ledgersmb-1.5 without the 
  fixes enabled in order to check how the fix permissions stanza in d/rules
  can be updated for that.
  - Referance also https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2899 which is
  for the creation of a test in upstream that checks for such permission issues.

- As of the packageing for 1.5.10, this is what is in the override_dh_fixperms
  stanza

Although Debian (and others) do now use systemd by default, it does still 
support sysvinit init.d scripts as well, so providing at least an example 
init.d sysvinit startup script for starman-ledgersmb would be quite useful.

- In the mean time, added an initial version of a possible script:
In order to test how that works, would have to use something that has been
changed to use sysv instead of systemd;  have been able to do some testing of it but it's
still not working properly so it needs more work.

  - debian/adm/config-lsmb-db-user.sh

- Use only the postgresql tools, like createuser, to set the user name and 
password for the LSMB DB Admin user?  David G pointed out that using SQL
can allow the unencrypted password to perhaps show up in logs, etc, which
is a security concern.  So, use the sql to be able to tell if the user
is already pressent but use the standard tools to actually set it?  Or can
those be used unattended like is needed here?

- Take out defaulting to doing the SQL 'ALTER' instead of a 'CREATE'
if the LSMB DBAdmin user already exits?  It was pointed out by both David
and Erik that they really don't think it's a good idea to reset that password
by default when, for instance, upgrading the package;  which is what it does
when doing the configure was enabled.  Add option to reset the password if the
user ID already exists, but not by default? Would have to explicitly agree
to it, each time, and that agreement isn't saved so the question gets asked
each time and by default is not to do the reset?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Use a separate source tarball for the UI/js/dojo and UI/js/dijit directories?
Devs have discussed it some but nothing has come of it as yet. If it's provided,
then a way to bypass all source-is-missing lintian errors on those directories
could be to use the multiple upstream tarballs functionality that's available
in the debian pkgformat being used. 

https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0
https://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/09/07/how-to-use-multiple-upstream-tarballs-in-debian-source-packages/  

google search: debian package multiple source files

Note that this isn't necessary for the UI/js/lsmb directory because the source
for those are in the UI/js-src/lsmb directory. Although could perhaps investigate
where and how the lintian check looks for the source files to see if repacking
them where it looks for them would resolve this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Currently have texlive-latex-recommended as a Recommends but that pulls a lot of
of other pkgs in and takes alot of space, and is only there regarding being able
to print to PDF.  Options for how replace that at least for default printing
(some people will continue to use LaTex because they have dedicated resources
to it) have/are being generated, like modules or apps to print from html to pdf.
  Once that has been implemented, move the texlive requirement from Recommends to
Suggests and add some info about it to the README.Debian.

- Note that what has been discussed for an alternate default for printing has
been 'wkhtml2pdf'. See also:
https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues/2719
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version? And to recreate the pdf version, to insure that it
is the from the current source file?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?
