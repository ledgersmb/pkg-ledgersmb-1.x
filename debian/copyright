Comment: Copyright and License for debian directory files, which were originally
 adapted from the 'ledgersmb' Debian package. Note that originally, the License
 was noted as being "GPL" but that is currently the same as GPL-3 but LedgerSMB
 was originally debianized on Mon, 13 Nov 2006 15:29:53, while the GPL-3 was
 released in 2007. So, noting it as GPL-2+ rather than GPL-3(GPL), the same as
 that for LedgerSMB itself.
