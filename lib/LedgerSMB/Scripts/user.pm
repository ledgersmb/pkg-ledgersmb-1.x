=head1 NAME

LedgerSMB::Scripts::user - web entry points for user self-administration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

User preferences and password setting routines for LedgerSMB.  These are all
accessible to all users and do not perform administrative functions.

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM ADMIN MODULE

Although there is some overlap between this module and that of the admin module,
particularly regarding the setting of passwords, there are subtle differences as
well.  Most notably an administrative password reset is valid by default for
only one day, while the duration of a user password change is fully configurable
and defaults to indefinite validity.
